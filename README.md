#Problem Statement 
Machine Reading of Customer Feedback -- under the ministry of railways

#The Solution

Our team, Janmitra, from IIT ISM Dhanbad, represented the college in Udaipur. Their problem statement was "Machine Reading of Customer Feedback" under the ministry of railways. We gave a robust solution of fetching complaints, classifying them, sending complaints to concerned departments of concerned divisions of the zones and finally making the algorithm self learning by taking feedback from the ministry of Railways. The complaints were taken from Twitter, SMS, handwritten Telegram and Voice. The complaint tweets were getting replies in real time asking for additional information if needed. Finally, the complaints were showing up on the department application with the feature of feedback. This solution won the 2nd prize and glory to the college.
